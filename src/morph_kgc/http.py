HTTP access
===========
The HTTP client of the engine: the resources declared in ``[RESOURCE:<name>]``
config sections and the stateful functions that access them, and the HTTP API
data sources. It is built on ``urllib`` so that fetching a vocabulary, querying
a SPARQL endpoint or reading an HTTP API needs no dependency beyond the
standard library.

Supports HTTP Basic Authentication (preemptive: the ``Authorization`` header is
sent with the first request, as required by endpoints that answer 401 without a
``WWW-Authenticate`` challenge), query parameters, caller-supplied headers,
transparent gzip decompression, and local paths, which are read from disk.

Redirects are followed, but the credentials of a request are only sent to the
origin (scheme, host and port) they were given for, or to its https version, and
a POST keeps its method and body unless redirected with 303 See Other.
Credentials written in a URL (``https://user:password@host``) are rejected.
