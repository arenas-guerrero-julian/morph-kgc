SKOS vocabulary resources
=========================
Builds a :class:`~morph_kgc.reconciliation.index.ConceptIndex` from a SKOS
vocabulary fetched from the URL declared by a ``[RESOURCE:<name>]`` section::

    [RESOURCE:disease_vocabulary]
    resource_type=SKOS_VOCABULARY
    url=https://example.org/vocabulary/disease
    username={VOCABULARY_USER}
    password={VOCABULARY_PASSWORD}
    format=turtle
    attributes=skos:prefLabel,skos:altLabel
    timeout=60

The vocabulary is retrieved once, during the context initialization phase. It
may be serialized as triples or as quads (N-Quads, TriG): the concepts of every
graph of a vocabulary split across named graphs are indexed.

How values are matched against the vocabulary is chosen by each execution of
the mapping, not here. A vocabulary that some executions match exactly and
others case-insensitively gets an index for each, built from a single download.

The vocabulary is downloaded to the state directory of the run and parsed as a
stream, its labels going to the index on disk as they are read, so that indexing
a vocabulary takes the same memory whatever its size. A serialization the
streaming parser cannot read (TriX, a JSON-LD document with a remote context, a
document breaking the syntax in ways rdflib tolerates) is parsed in memory with
rdflib instead, as a fallback, with a warning. Where the streaming parser keeps
a typed literal as written (``"01"^^xsd:integer`` is matched by ``01``), rdflib
normalizes it (matched by ``1``). A JSON-LD document whose top level is an
object (``@context`` and ``@graph``) is read whole before its first statement,
also with a warning: only a top-level array of nodes is read as a stream.

The ``attributes`` are absolute IRIs, or prefixed names with one of the
well-known prefixes in :data:`WELL_KNOWN_PREFIXES` (``skos:``, ``dcterms:``,
``schema:``, ...). An attribute in any other namespace is written as a full IRI.
