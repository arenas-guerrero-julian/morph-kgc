Concept index
=============
What a reconciliation function is initialized with: for each indexed attribute
(``skos:prefLabel``, ``skos:altLabel``, ...) the values it takes, and the
concepts they identify. The answer to a SPARQL query, which says nothing of
attributes, is indexed under a single, unnamed one, and may match entities by
several values together, such as a code and the scheme it belongs to: an index
then holds a column for each, and is looked up by the tuple of their values.

The index is built once during the context initialization phase and is then
read-only, which is what makes it safe to share across mapping rules and worker
processes. Its entries are kept on disk, as a Parquet file of the state
directory of the run (see :mod:`morph_kgc.functions.tables`), sorted by the
normalized value they are looked up by: the shared context only holds the path
of the file, and a worker reads the parts of the file its lookups need, so that
memory does not grow with the size of the vocabulary.
