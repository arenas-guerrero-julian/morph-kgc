# Reconciliation against a SKOS vocabulary

Reconciliation maps a value of the input data to the entity it identifies in a
controlled vocabulary or a knowledge graph. Morph-KGC ships two **stateful**
functions for it:

| Function | Reconciles against |
| --- | --- |
| `urn:morph:function:reconciliation:reconcileVocabularyConcept` | a SKOS vocabulary fetched from a URL |
| `urn:morph:function:reconcileEntityOverSPARQL` | the entities of any knowledge graph behind a SPARQL endpoint, selected by a query of the mapping |

Both are initialized **once**, before any triple is materialized: the vocabulary
is downloaded (or the query sent) a single time and the resulting index is
shared by every mapping rule and every worker process. No repeated API call is
made while generating triples.

This example reconciles against a SKOS vocabulary. Run it with:

```bash
python run.py
```

[`../reconciliation-sparql`](../reconciliation-sparql) reconciles against a
knowledge graph through a SPARQL endpoint.

## The accessed resource lives in the configuration file

The mapping only names the resource it reconciles against. Where that resource
is, how it is authenticated and how values are matched are declared in the
configuration file, so the same mapping runs unchanged against a local copy of a
vocabulary, a staging server or production:

```ini
[RESOURCE:disease_vocabulary]
resource_type=SKOS_VOCABULARY
url=https://example.org/vocabulary/disease
username={VOCABULARY_USER}
password={VOCABULARY_PASSWORD}
matching=CASE-INSENSITIVE
```

```turtle
<#DiseaseReconciliationExecution>
    rml:function morph-fr:reconcileVocabularyConcept ;
    rml:input [
        rml:parameter morph-fn:resource ;
        rml:inputValue "disease_vocabulary"
    ] ;
    rml:input [
        rml:parameter grel:valueParam ;
        rml:inputValueMap [ rml:reference "disease_label" ]
    ] ;
    rml:input [
        rml:parameter morph-fn:attributeIRI ;
        rml:inputValue skos:prefLabel , skos:altLabel
    ] .
```

`{ENV_VAR}` placeholders in `url`, `username` and `password` are replaced with
environment variables, so credentials need not be written to the file at all.

## Resource options

| Option | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `resource_type` | `SKOS_VOCABULARY` |
| `url` | where the vocabulary is downloaded from. A local path is read from disk |
| `iri` | the IRI identifying the vocabulary, when it differs from `url`. A mapping may name the resource by it |
| `username`, `password` | HTTP Basic Authentication credentials |
| `format` | RDF serialization of the vocabulary (`turtle`, `xml`, `nt`, `nquads`, `trig`, `json-ld`, ...). Guessed from the response and the URL when omitted. A vocabulary serialized as quads is indexed across all its named graphs |
| `matching` | `EXACT` (default) or `CASE-INSENSITIVE`, which also collapses whitespace |
| `attributes` | comma-separated attributes to index when the mapping names none |
| `timeout` | seconds to wait for the vocabulary (default `30`) |

## Function parameters

| Parameter | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `grel:valueParam` | the value to reconcile |
| `morph-fn:resource` | name of the `[RESOURCE:<name>]` section to reconcile against. May be omitted when a single vocabulary is declared. `morph-fn:vocabularyIRI` is an accepted spelling, and also accepts the IRI identifying the vocabulary |
| `morph-fn:attributeIRI` | the vocabulary property (or properties) the value is matched against, e.g. `skos:prefLabel`. Bind it several times to match against several: they are matched as a union, since RDF puts no order on the values of a property. `grel:attributeIRI` is accepted as well |

A value matching no concept yields no triple. A value matching several concepts
yields one triple per matched concept.

## Writing your own stateful function

Any user-defined function can be given a shared context in the same way; see
[`../stateful_udfs.py`](../stateful_udfs.py).
