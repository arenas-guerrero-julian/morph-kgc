# Reconciliation against a SKOS vocabulary

Reconciliation maps a value of the input data to the entity it identifies in a
controlled vocabulary or a knowledge graph. Morph-KGC ships two **stateful**
functions for it:

| Function | Reconciles against |
| --- | --- |
| `urn:morph:function:reconciliation:reconcileVocabularyConcept` | a SKOS vocabulary fetched from a URL |
| `urn:morph:function:reconcileEntityOverSPARQL` | the entities of any knowledge graph behind a SPARQL endpoint, selected by a query of the mapping |

Both are initialized **once**, before any triple is materialized: the vocabulary
is downloaded (or the query sent) a single time and the resulting index is
shared by every mapping rule and every worker process. No repeated API call is
made while generating triples.

The index is kept **on disk**, as a Parquet file of the state directory of the
run. Memory used does not grow with the size of
the vocabulary: the system uses at most the `state_memory_limit` of the
configuration file (`512MB` by default) and spills to the state directory.

This example reconciles against a SKOS vocabulary. Run it with:

```bash
python run.py
```

[`../reconciliation-sparql`](../reconciliation-sparql) reconciles against a
knowledge graph through a SPARQL endpoint.

## The accessed resource lives in the configuration file

The mapping only names the resource it reconciles against. Where that resource
is and how it is authenticated are declared in the configuration file, so the
same mapping runs unchanged against a local copy of a vocabulary, a staging
server or production. How values are matched against it changes the triples
generated, so the mapping says it:

```ini
[RESOURCE:disease_vocabulary]
resource_type=SKOS_VOCABULARY
url=https://example.org/vocabulary/disease
username={VOCABULARY_USER}
password={VOCABULARY_PASSWORD}
```

```turtle
<#DiseaseReconciliationExecution>
    rml:function morph-fr:reconcileVocabularyConcept ;
    rml:input [
        rml:parameter morph-fn:resource ;
        rml:inputValue "disease_vocabulary"
    ] ;
    rml:input [
        rml:parameter grel:valueParam ;
        rml:inputValueMap [ rml:reference "disease_label" ]
    ] ;
    rml:input [
        rml:parameter morph-fn:attributeIRI ;
        rml:inputValue skos:prefLabel , skos:altLabel
    ] ;
    rml:input [
        rml:parameter morph-fn:matching ;
        rml:inputValue "CASE-INSENSITIVE"
    ] .
```

An object map using the function needs `rml:termType rml:IRI`: one whose value is the result of
a function generates literals by default.

`{ENV_VAR}` placeholders in `iri`, `url`, `username` and `password` are replaced
with environment variables, so credentials need not be written to the file at
all.

## Resource options

| Option | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `resource_type` | `SKOS_VOCABULARY`. |
| `url` | where the vocabulary is downloaded from. A local path is read from disk. |
| `iri` | the IRI identifying the vocabulary, when it differs from `url`. A mapping may name the resource by it. |
| `username`, `password` | HTTP Basic Authentication credentials. |
| `format` | RDF serialization of the vocabulary (`turtle`, `xml`, `nt`, `nquads`, `trig`, `json-ld`, ...). Guessed from the response and the URL when omitted. A vocabulary serialized as quads is indexed across all its named graphs. |
| `attributes` | comma-separated attributes the value is matched against when the execution names none, as IRIs or as prefixed names (`skos:prefLabel`) with one of the prefixes `skos`, `rdf`, `rdfs`, `owl`, `xsd`, `dc`, `dcterms`/`dct`, `schema` (`https://schema.org/`) or `foaf`; an attribute in another namespace is written as a full IRI. Without it, every property whose value is a literal. |
| `timeout` | seconds to wait for the vocabulary (default `30`). |
| `ambiguity` | the policy for the values matching several concepts of the vocabulary, when the execution sets none: `ALL` (default), `NONE` or `FAIL`. See [Ambiguous values](#ambiguous-values). |

The values matched to no concept, and to several, can be reported to a file;
see [Reconciliation report](#reconciliation-report).

## Function parameters

| Parameter | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `grel:valueParam` | the value to reconcile (`grel:valueParam1` is accepted as well). A concept is matched by a single value. |
| `morph-fn:resource` | name of the `[RESOURCE:<name>]` section to reconcile against. May be omitted when a single vocabulary is declared. `morph-fn:vocabularyIRI` is an accepted spelling, and also accepts the IRI identifying the vocabulary. |
| `morph-fn:attributeIRI` | the vocabulary property (or properties) the value is matched against, e.g. `skos:prefLabel`. Bind it several times to match against several: they are matched as a union, since RDF puts no order on the values of a property. `grel:attributeIRI` is accepted as well, and both may be bound together. When omitted, the `attributes` option of the resource applies. |
| `morph-fn:matching` | how the value is matched: `EXACT` (default), `LOWERCASE` or `CASE-INSENSITIVE`. See [Ways of matching values](#ways-of-matching-values). A constant, since the vocabulary is indexed before any data is read. Executions matching the same vocabulary differently share a single download of it. |
| `morph-fn:ambiguity` | what a value matching several concepts is reconciled to: `ALL` (default), `NONE` or `FAIL`. See [Ambiguous values](#ambiguous-values). A constant, overriding the `ambiguity` option of the resource. |

A value matching no concept yields no triple. Resources typed as concept schemes or
collections are never matched. The concepts are IRIs, so an object map
generating them needs `rml:termType rml:IRI`.

## Ways of matching values

`morph-fn:matching` says how the value and the labels of the vocabulary are
compared. In the examples below, the value `Café␠` ends with a space, which
`␠` stands for:

| Matching | Compares values | `Café␠` matches | `Straße` matches |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `EXACT` | as they are. The default. | `Café␠` | `Straße` |
| `LOWERCASE` | lower-cased, and nothing else: no whitespace is trimmed or collapsed, and no Unicode normalization is applied. | `café␠`, `CAFÉ␠`; not `Café` (no space), `cafe`, `café␠␠` (two spaces) or `café␠` decomposed (NFD) | `straße`; not `strasse` |
| `CASE-INSENSITIVE` | normalized (NFKC), with their whitespace collapsed, and case-folded. | `café␠`, `Café` (no space), `café␠␠` (two spaces), `café␠` decomposed (NFD)...; not `cafe` | `strasse`, `STRASSE`, `straße` |

`LOWERCASE` lower-cases values with Python's `str.lower()`, which matches as a
Lucene index analyzing them with `KeywordTokenizer` and `LowerCaseFilter` does,
but for two characters: `LowerCaseFilter` lower-cases `İ` as `i`, where
`str.lower()` gives `i` followed by a combining dot above, and a final `Σ` as
`σ`, where `str.lower()` gives `ς`. `CASE-INSENSITIVE` matches more, which may
turn a value matching a single concept into an ambiguous one.

`urn:morph:function:reconcileEntityOverSPARQL` matches values in the same ways,
with the same results: the same data, mapping and way of matching values give
the same triples whether the vocabulary is read from a file or queried from a
SPARQL endpoint holding it (see
[`../reconciliation-sparql`](../reconciliation-sparql/README.md)).

## Ambiguous values

A value matching several concepts, such as a label that is the preferred label
of one concept and an alternative label of another, is ambiguous. What it is
reconciled to is a policy, which an execution chooses with `morph-fn:ambiguity`,
and the `ambiguity` option of the resource sets for the executions that do not:

| Policy | An ambiguous value yields |
| --- | --- |
| `ALL` | one triple per matched concept. The default. |
| `NONE` | no triple. |
| `FAIL` | no triple, as the run is aborted with an error. |

```turtle
    rml:input [
        rml:parameter morph-fn:ambiguity ;
        rml:inputValue "NONE"
    ] .
```

```ini
[RESOURCE:disease_vocabulary]
resource_type=SKOS_VOCABULARY
url=https://example.org/vocabulary/disease
ambiguity=NONE
```

With `NONE`, each ambiguous value is reported in the log, together with the
concepts it matches, as a warning starting with `MULTIPLE_MATCH`, so that the
values left without a triple can be reviewed (set `logging_file` in the
configuration file to keep them in a file):

```
MULTIPLE_MATCH: value 'Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia-deafness-narcolepsy syndrome' matches 2 entities of resource 'disease_vocabulary': <https://data.boehringer.com/id/00036/10077339>, <https://example.org/vocabulary/disease/adca-dn>. No triple is generated for it, as the ambiguity policy is NONE.
```

With `ALL`, the report is a debug record (`logging_level=DEBUG`). With `FAIL`,
it is the message of the error aborting the run, rather than a record of the
log. A process writes each record once, however many rows and mapping rules
hold the value.

## Reconciliation report

The values matched to no concept, and to several, are written to a report, in
[JSON Lines](https://jsonlines.org) (one JSON object per line), when the
configuration file names it:

```ini
[CONFIGURATION]
reconciliation_report=reports/reconciliation.jsonl
```

It holds one line per distinct value an execution matched to no entity
(`NO_MATCH`) or to several (`MULTIPLE_MATCH`) of a resource, whatever the
number of rows holding it, of mapping rules reconciling it and of processes
(`number_of_processes`), written when the run ends, also when it is aborted
(ambiguity `FAIL`). Its directory is created as the configuration is read,
and a path it cannot be written to is an error then. With the vocabulary
`disease_vocabulary_ambiguous.ttl` of the tests and `ambiguity=NONE` (see
[Ambiguous values](#ambiguous-values)), this example writes:

```json
{"outcome": "MULTIPLE_MATCH", "value": "Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia-deafness-narcolepsy syndrome", "normalized_value": "Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia-deafness-narcolepsy syndrome", "resource": "disease_vocabulary", "matching": "EXACT", "ambiguity": "NONE", "candidates": ["https://data.boehringer.com/id/00036/10077339", "https://example.org/vocabulary/disease/adca-dn"], "function_iri": "urn:morph:function:reconciliation:reconcileVocabularyConcept", "execution_id": "http://example.com/base/#DiseaseReconciliationExecution", "triples_maps": ["http://example.com/base/#DiseaseResourceMapping", "http://example.com/base/#PatientsMapping"], "sources": ["patients.csv"], "data_sources": ["PatientsDataSource"], "mappings": ["mapping.ttl"]}
```

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `outcome` | `NO_MATCH` or `MULTIPLE_MATCH`. |
| `value`, `normalized_value` | the value as read (a string, whatever a nested function returned), and as looked up (see [Ways of matching values](#ways-of-matching-values)); arrays for an entity matched by several values. |
| `resource` | the resource reconciled against; `endpoint` and `query_hash` (SHA-256 of the query) for a SPARQL endpoint. |
| `matching` | the way values were matched. |
| `ambiguity`, `candidates` | for `MULTIPLE_MATCH`: the ambiguity policy, which says whether triples were generated, and the entities matched. |
| `function_iri`, `execution_id` | the function and its execution in the mapping. |
| `triples_maps`, `sources`, `data_sources`, `mappings` | the triples maps reconciling the value, their logical sources, the sections of the configuration file declaring them, and their mapping files. |

A value is reported once for each execution, resource and outcome, with the
candidates of all the rows holding it (attributes read from the data may match
it to no entity in one row and to several in another). Only the values of the
rows that reach the term they are reconciled for are reported: not those of a
row missing a column the mapping rule references (see `na_values`), nor those
of a row an earlier term of the rule yields no value for. When the subject of a
row is reconciled to no entity, for instance, its object is neither reconciled
nor reported; reconcile them in separate triples maps for the report to hold
both. A summary of each execution is logged (`INFO`), counting the rows each
mapping rule reconciled, without its duplicates, and the distinct values
reported:

```
Execution 'http://example.com/base/#DiseaseReconciliationExecution' of function 'urn:morph:function:reconciliation:reconcileVocabularyConcept' handled 6 value(s): 3 matched, 3 ambiguous (1 distinct).
```

## Writing your own stateful function

Any user-defined function can be given a shared context in the same way, kept
in memory or, when large, in an on-disk table; see
[`../stateful_udfs.py`](../stateful_udfs.py).
