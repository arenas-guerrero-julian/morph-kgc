# Reconciliation against a knowledge graph through SPARQL

Reconciliation maps a value of the input data to the entity it identifies in an
existing knowledge graph, so that the generated graph reuses its IRIs instead of
minting new ones. `urn:morph:function:reconcileEntityOverSPARQL`, requested in
[discussion #339](https://github.com/morph-kgc/morph-kgc/discussions/339),
reconciles against the entities of any knowledge graph behind a SPARQL
endpoint, selected by a SPARQL query written in the mapping.
[`../reconciliation`](../reconciliation) reconciles against a SKOS vocabulary
fetched from a URL instead.

It is a **stateful** function: the query is sent **once**, before any triple is
materialized, and the resulting index of entities is shared by every mapping
rule and every worker process. No query is sent while generating triples.

Run this example with:

```bash
python run.py
```

[`endpoint.py`](endpoint.py) is a small SPARQL endpoint answering queries over
[`clinical_trials.trig`](clinical_trials.trig), so that the example needs no
triplestore of its own; `run.py` starts it. Its request log shows the single
query sent for the whole materialization. To run the example from the command
line instead, start the endpoint yourself:

```bash
python endpoint.py &
morph-kgc config.ini
```

## The endpoint and the query are in the mapping

The mapping says which endpoint to query and which entities to reconcile
against:

```turtle
<#ClinicalTrialReconciliation>
    rml:function morph-fn:reconcileEntityOverSPARQL ;
    rml:input [
        rml:parameter morph-fn:sparqlEndpointUrl ;
        rml:inputValue "http://127.0.0.1:8890/sparql"
    ] ;
    rml:input [
        rml:parameter morph-fn:sparqlQuery ;
        rml:inputValue """
            PREFIX schema: <https://schema.org/>
            SELECT ?entity_iri ?matching_value_1 WHERE {
                GRAPH ?g {
                    ?entity_iri a schema:MedicalStudy ;
                                schema:identifier ?matching_value_1 .
                }
            }
        """
    ] ;
    rml:input [
        rml:parameter grel:valueParam ;
        rml:inputValueMap [ rml:reference "clinical_trial_id" ]
    ] .
```

The query is any SELECT query over the knowledge graph. It projects two
variables:

| Variable | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `?entity_iri` | the entity a value is reconciled with |
| `?matching_value_1` | the value the entity is matched by |

A value is matched against `?matching_value_1` only. To match it against
several properties, bind all of them to that variable, e.g. with a `UNION` or a
property path (`schema:identifier|schema:alternateName`). Other projected
variables, such as `?g`, are ignored, but `?matching_value_2` and the like are
rejected, since no value is matched against them. A query that does not project
both `?entity_iri` and `?matching_value_1` fails instead of reconciling nothing.

Values are matched exactly. To match them whatever their case, normalize both
sides in the mapping: `BIND(LCASE(STR(?identifier)) AS ?matching_value_1)` in
the query, and a nested `grel:toLowerCase` execution as `grel:valueParam`.

Declare the prefixes the query uses: an endpoint is not bound to know `schema:`
or any other prefix.

Since each reconciliation brings its own query, a mapping reconciles as many
kinds of entities, against as many endpoints, as it needs: one execution per
query, and the same query sent to the same endpoint by several executions is
sent once. When the reconciled entity is the object of a triple, give its object
map `rml:termType rml:IRI` (`type: iri` in YARRRML), since an object map whose
value is the result of a function generates literals by default.

### Named graphs

The query is sent as written. Stores differ on whether their default graph
includes the named graphs: GraphDB and Virtuoso include them, Fuseki, Oxigraph
and Stardog do not by default. On the latter, a knowledge graph that keeps its
entities in named graphs, as the one of this example does, is read with a
`GRAPH ?g { ... }` pattern. Without it, the query of this example finds no
entity: no triple is generated, and a warning says so. A query meant for any
store reads both the default graph and the named graphs:
`{ P } UNION { GRAPH ?g { P } }`.

### Writing the query in a mapping

In Turtle, write the query as a `"""..."""` literal and double every backslash
of the query: `regex(?id, "^NCT\\d+$")` is written `regex(?id, "^NCT\\\\d+$")`.
In YARRRML, write it as a `|` block scalar, which keeps it exactly as written. Some stores cap the
number of results they return (e.g. `ResultSetMaxRows` in Virtuoso); values of
entities left out of the answer are not reconciled.

## The configuration file is only for access control

An endpoint open to everyone needs nothing but its URL in the mapping, which is
why [`config.ini`](config.ini) declares no resource. An access-controlled
endpoint is declared with its credentials, in a `[RESOURCE:<name>]` section
whose `url` is the endpoint the mapping names:

```ini
[RESOURCE:clinical_trials]
resource_type=SPARQL_ENDPOINT
url=https://data.com/database/query
username={ENDPOINT_USER}
password={ENDPOINT_PASSWORD}
```

`{ENV_VAR}` placeholders in `url`, `iri`, `username` and `password` are replaced
with environment variables, so credentials need not be written to the file at
all.

| Option | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `resource_type` | `SPARQL_ENDPOINT` |
| `url` | where the endpoint is queried |
| `iri` | the endpoint the mapping names, when it is not `url`. A mapping naming a production endpoint then runs against a local or staging one, declared as `url` |
| `username`, `password` | HTTP Basic Authentication credentials |
| `method` | `GET` or `POST`. By default, `GET`, or `POST` for a query too long for a URL |
| `timeout` | seconds to wait for the answer to the query (default `300`) |

Credentials written in the endpoint URL of the mapping (`https://user:password@...`)
are rejected, so that they never end up in a mapping.

## Function parameters

| Parameter | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `grel:valueParam` | the value to reconcile |
| `morph-fn:sparqlEndpointUrl` | the URL of the SPARQL endpoint the query is sent to |
| `morph-fn:sparqlQuery` | the SELECT query returning `?entity_iri` and `?matching_value_1` |

The endpoint and the query are constants of the mapping, since they are sent
before any data is read. A value matching no entity yields no triple. A value
matching several entities yields one triple per matched entity.

## What this example generates

The patients of [`patients.csv`](patients.csv) are linked to the clinical trials
they participate in, using the IRIs of the knowledge graph:

```
<urn:id:p1> <https://example.org/ontology/participatesIn> <https://data.com/id/1> .
<urn:id:p2> <https://example.org/ontology/participatesIn> <https://data.com/id/2> .
<urn:id:p2> <https://example.org/ontology/participatesIn> <https://data.com/id/3> .
```

                                            schema:identifier ?matching_value_1 .
                            }
                        }
                    - parameter: grel:valueParam
                      value: $(clinical_trial_id)
```

## Writing your own stateful function

Any user-defined function can be given a shared context in the same way; see
[`../stateful_udfs.py`](../stateful_udfs.py).
